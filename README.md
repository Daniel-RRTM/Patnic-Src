* **Systemic Design** and **DOP** to enable emergent Gameplay and personal narratives.

**Its Content-creator**

## Documentation
Panicroom is big in size and quite complex.Thats why momentarily focuse on the **Documentation of the Base-game** alone.  
We also appreciate feedback to improve its wording, formatting and Navigation!

Visit our [**Wiki**](https://daniel-rrr.github.io/wiki.html) if you are a **player** and looking for some specific information on a Game-object like an item, abillity or race.

Visit our [**Docs**](https://daniel-rrr.github.io/docs.html) if you are a **modder** or **creator** and looking for explanations of Game-Systems like Tilemaps and their APIs with examples on how to use them.  
(The Wiki may still be interesting for you)
